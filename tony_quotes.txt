“Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.”
"I haven't come across anyone man enough to go toe to toe with me on my best day! It's not about me. It's not about you, either. It's about legacy, the legacy left behind for future generations. It's not about us!"

"In a world this vulnerable, we need something more powerful than any of us."
“I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you.”
